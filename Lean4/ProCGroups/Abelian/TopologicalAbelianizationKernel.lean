# Kernels after topological abelianization

For a continuous surjection from a compact group to a Hausdorff group, the
kernel of the induced map on topological abelianizations is the image of the
original kernel. Compactness makes the image of the closed commutator closed,
so every target commutator class has a lift in the source closed commutator.
