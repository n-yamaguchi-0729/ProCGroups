# Completed Group Algebra / Universal Property / Basic

This module packages canonical completed-group-algebra models by their finite-stage cone and
inverse-limit universal property, derives comparison equivalences, and develops the continuous
group-like map and its spanning properties.

/-- Certificate that a profinite ring realizes the inverse limit of the finite group algebras
`R[G/U]` for bundled profinite coefficients and group.

The data are the bundled finite-stage ring homomorphisms, their compatibility with the specified
algebraic map, and the inverse-limit universal property.  Continuity and transition compatibility
of the projections are contained in `isInverseLimit`.  In particular, no comparison with the
canonical carrier is assumed: the comparison homeomorphism and ring equivalence below are derived
from the universal property.  Profiniteness is inherited from the three bundled objects rather
than repeated as certificate fields. -/
