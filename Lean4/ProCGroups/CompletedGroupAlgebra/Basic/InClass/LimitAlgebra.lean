# Completed Group Algebra / Basic / Within a Class / Limit Algebra

This module gives the \(C\)-indexed completion the same opaque-carrier API as the all-finite
completion. Its inverse-limit representation is exchanged explicitly, while projections,
compatibility, and extensionality are the ordinary public interface. Algebraic structures are
inherited from the generic ring and module inverse limits.
