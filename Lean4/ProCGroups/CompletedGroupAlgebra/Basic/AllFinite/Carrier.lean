# Completed Group Algebra / Basic / All Finite / Carrier

This module defines the all-finite completed group algebra as a named inverse-limit carrier.
Its compatible-family realization is available only through the explicit equivalence, coordinate
projection, compatibility, and extensionality API below. Ring and module structures are inherited
once from the generic inverse-limit construction.
