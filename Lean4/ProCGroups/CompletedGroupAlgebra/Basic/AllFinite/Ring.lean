# Completed Group Algebra / Basic / All Finite / Ring Maps

The carrier and its algebraic structures come from the single generic inverse-limit construction.
This module adds the stagewise coefficient-change map and the coefficient algebra map. Generic
ring-homomorphism lemmas apply directly to the canonical bundled projections.
