# Profinite spaces as limits of finite discrete quotients

Clopen equivalence relations on a compact Hausdorff totally disconnected space form an inverse
system of finite discrete quotients.  This module constructs the canonical homeomorphism from
the space to that inverse limit and also proves the clopen-basis criterion used in the converse
direction.
