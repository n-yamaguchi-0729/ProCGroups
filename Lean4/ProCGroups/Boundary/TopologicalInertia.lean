# Topologically cyclic inertia and cyclotomic inversion

This file upgrades the elementwise abelian consequence of cyclotomic
inversion to a statement about an entire topologically cyclic inertia group.
The generator is killed by inversion and oddness, and continuity then kills
the whole restriction.

/-- A continuous map to an abelian Hausdorff group is trivial on a
topologically cyclic inertia group when the image of a topological generator
has order prime to two and its ambient image is conjugate to its inverse. -/
