# Reidemeister Schreier / Discrete / Reidemeister Schreier / Finite Quotient / Word Certificates

This module records checkable prefix-closure conditions for quotient-section
words and proves the reduced-word and state-transition facts required by the
finite tau presentation.

/--
Prefix-closedness along a concrete word list, starting at quotient state \(q\). Positive letters
require the next representative to be obtained by appending \(x\); negative letters require the
current representative to be obtained by appending \(x\) to the previous state.
