# Fox differential: completed — differential module — map — limit

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap`
  The ring homomorphism on prime-power completed group algebras induced stagewise by a continuous
  group homomorphism.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_map`
  The finite-stage Fox-differential projection is computed by the prime-power completed
  group-algebra projection formula.
- `continuous_primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap`
  The completed group-algebra map induced by a continuous homomorphism is continuous for the
  inverse-limit topologies.
