# Fox differential: completed — differential module — target quotient — stage map

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMapStage_targetQuotient_transition_source`
  At a completed finite stage of \(F/N\), the completed map induced by \(F \to F/N\) agrees with
  first projecting to the completed free derivative source finite quotient and then using the
  completed free derivative natural finite-stage group-algebra map.
- `primePowerCompletedGAProj_map_targetQuotient_eq_freeDerivativeSource`
  The target finite-stage projection of the completed quotient map can be computed using the
  completed free derivative source projection at the same prime-power exponent.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap_targetQuotient_of`
  The target-quotient prime-power map sends a group-like basis element to the basis element
  supported at its target-quotient image.
