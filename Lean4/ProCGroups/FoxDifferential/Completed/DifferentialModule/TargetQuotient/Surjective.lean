# Fox differential: completed — differential module — target quotient — surjective

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap_targetQuotient_lift`
  A noncomputable lift of a completed target group-algebra coefficient to the source completed group
  algebra. The defining equation is
  \(\mathrm{primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap\_targetQuotient\_lift\_spec}\).
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetQuotientContinuousMonoidHom_surjective`
  The quotient homomorphism \(\mathrm{FreeGroup}(X) \to \mathrm{FreeGroup}(X)/N\) is surjective.
  This specialized form is used to lift coefficients from \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\llbracket
  F/N\rrbracket\) to \(\mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\llbracket F\rrbracket\) in the completed Fox derivative.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap_targetQuotient_surjective`
  The completed group-algebra map attached to \(\mathrm{FreeGroup}(X) \to \mathrm{FreeGroup}(X)/N\)
  is surjective. This is the coefficient-lifting input for the surjectivity half of \(K/KI \to L\).
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraMap_targetQuotient_lift_spec`
  The chosen coefficient lift maps back to the prescribed completed target coefficient.
