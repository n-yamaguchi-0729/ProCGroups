# Fox differential: completed — differential module — target quotient — fundamental

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `ppCompletedGAFoxDerivToTarget_of_fundFormula_map`
  The completed Fox derivative satisfies the fundamental formula after passage to the target
  quotient.
- `ppCompletedGAFoxDerivToTarget_of_mul_product_map`
  The completed Fox derivative of a product is computed by the crossed product rule after passage to
  the target quotient.
