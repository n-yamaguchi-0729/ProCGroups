# Fox differential: completed — differential module — target quotient — basic

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetQuotientContinuousMonoidHom`
  The completed Fox-differential map is continuous with respect to the inverse-limit topology on the
  completed coefficient modules.
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetQuotientContinuousMonoidHom_apply`
  The finite-stage target quotient homomorphism sends a word to its quotient class modulo \(N\).
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerSourceCompletedIndex_le_targetQuotientComap`
  The completed free derivative source finite stage \([N,N]N^{ell^a}\) refines every finite stage
  pulled back from the target quotient \(F/N\). This order comparison lets the completed
  group-algebra projection for \(\pi: \mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\llbracket F\rrbracket \to
  \mathbb{Z}_{\ell}\llbracket F/N\rrbracket\) be computed from the completed free derivative source
  projection.
