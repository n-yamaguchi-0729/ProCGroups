# Fox differential: finite stage — stage — derivative — lift

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageLift`
  Semidirect-product lift defining the finite-stage Fox derivative.
- `foxAlgebraicStageDerivativeVector`
  Finite-stage Fox derivative vector of a free-group word.
- `foxAlgebraicStageLift_right`
  The right component of the finite-stage lift is the quotient class in \(F/N\).
- `foxAlgebraicStageCoefficient_apply`
  The finite Fox-stage coefficient map is evaluated by applying the selected coefficient projection.
