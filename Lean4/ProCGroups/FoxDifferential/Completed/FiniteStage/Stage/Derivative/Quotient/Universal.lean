# Fox differential: stage — derivative — quotient — universal

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientDerivativeVectorLinearMap`
  The linear map from the quotient universal crossed-differential module representing the descended
  finite-stage Fox derivative vector.
- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientDerivativeVectorLinearMap_universal`
  The quotient derivative-vector linear map evaluates on the universal differential as the descended
  finite-stage Fox derivative vector.
- `existsUnique_foxAlgebraicStageQuotientDerivativeVectorLinearMap`
  Existence and uniqueness of the linear map representing the descended finite-stage Fox derivative
  vector on the finite source quotient.
