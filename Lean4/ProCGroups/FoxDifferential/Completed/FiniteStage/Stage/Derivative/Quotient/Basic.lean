# Fox differential: stage — derivative — quotient — basic

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientLift`
  The finite-stage lift descended to the source quotient \(F/[N,N]N^n\).
- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientCoefficient`
  Coefficient homomorphism for the finite-stage quotient crossed homomorphism.
- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientLift_mk`
  Evaluation of the descended finite-stage lift on a representative.
- `foxAlgebraicStageQuotientLift_right`
  The right component of the descended finite-stage lift is the quotient map from \(F/[N,N]N^n\) to
  \(F/N\).
