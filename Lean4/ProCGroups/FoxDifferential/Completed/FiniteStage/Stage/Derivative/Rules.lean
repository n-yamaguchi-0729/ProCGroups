# Fox differential: finite stage — stage — derivative — rules

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageDerivativeVectorCrossedHom`
  The finite-stage Fox derivative vector, bundled with its scalar Fox--Leibniz law.
- `foxAlgebraicStageDerivative_one`
  The finite-stage derivative sends the identity word to zero componentwise.
- `foxAlgebraicStageDerivativeVector_of`
  The finite-stage derivative vector sends a free generator to the corresponding coordinate basis
  vector.
- `foxAlgebraicStageDerivative_mul`
  The finite-stage Fox product rule holds componentwise.
