# Fox differential: completed — finite stage — boundary cycle hom

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageSourceKernel`
  The kernel of the finite source-to-target quotient \(F/[N,N]N^n \to F/N\).
- `foxAlgebraicStageSourceKernelDerivativeAddHom`
  The descended finite-stage Fox derivative, restricted to the source quotient kernel, is an
  additive homomorphism.
- `foxAlgebraicStageSourceKernelDerivativeAddHom_of`
  The finite-stage boundary or derivative construction defines the corresponding additive
  homomorphism.
- `foxAlgebraicStageSourceKernelDerivativeAddHom_range_eq`
  The range of the additive source-kernel derivative map is exactly the source-kernel derivative
  additive subgroup already used in the finite-stage density target.
