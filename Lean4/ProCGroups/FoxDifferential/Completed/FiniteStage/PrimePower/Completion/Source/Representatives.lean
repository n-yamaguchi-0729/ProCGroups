# Fox differential: prime power — completion — source — representatives

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerSourceOf`
  The compatible source-limit family represented by a free-group word.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerTargetOf`
  The compatible target-limit family represented by a free-group word.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerSourceOf_projection`
  Projecting the source-limit element represented by a word gives the corresponding finite-stage
  source coordinate.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerSourceProjection_eq_sourceOf_projection`
  Projecting a group-like free-group algebra element to a source stage agrees with the corresponding
  source-limit projection.
