# Fox differential: finite stage — prime power — completion — target

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerTargetLimitToCompletedGroupAlgebra`
  The canonical additive map from the prime-power target inverse limit to the completed group
  algebra of the finite-stage target quotient.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerTargetLimitToCompletedGroupAlgebra_projection`
  Projecting the map from the prime-power target limit gives the corresponding completed target
  group-algebra coordinate.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerTargetLimitToCompletedGroupAlgebra_one`
  The target-limit-to-completed-group-algebra map preserves \(1\).
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerTargetLimitToCompletedGroupAlgebra_mul`
  The target-limit-to-completed-group-algebra map preserves multiplication.
