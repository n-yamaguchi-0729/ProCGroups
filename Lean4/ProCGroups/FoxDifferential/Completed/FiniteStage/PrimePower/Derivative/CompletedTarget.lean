# Fox differential: finite stage — prime power — derivative — completed target

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget`
  The completed source Fox derivative, mapped from the finite-stage target limit into the completed
  group algebra of the target quotient.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_projection`
  Projecting the completed-target Fox derivative gives the corresponding finite-stage derivative.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_unique`
  The completed-target prime-power Fox derivative is uniquely determined by all completed target
  finite-stage projection formulas.
- `ppCompletedGAFoxDerivToTarget_fundFormula_proj`
  The completed-target fundamental formula after projection to one completed target stage.
