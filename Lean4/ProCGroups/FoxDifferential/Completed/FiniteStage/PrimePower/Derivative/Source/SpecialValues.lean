# Fox differential: prime power — derivative — source — special values

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_one`
  The completed-target Fox derivative sends the unit of the completed source group algebra to zero.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_sub_one`
  Subtracting the unit from a group-like source element does not change its completed-target Fox
  derivative.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTarget_sub_one`
  Subtracting the unit from a group-like source element does not change its completed-target Fox
  derivative vector.
- `foxAlgebraicStagePrimePowerDerivativeLimit_sourceOf_toFamily`
  Family-level projection formula for the derivative limit of a group-like source element.
