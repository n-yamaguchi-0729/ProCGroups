# Fox differential: prime power — derivative — source — mul

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivative_of_mul`
  Product rule for the completed source Fox derivative on group-like source elements.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivative_of_mul_product`
  Product rule for the completed source Fox derivative when the source product is written in the
  completed group algebra.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_of_mul`
  Product rule for the completed-target Fox derivative on group-like source elements.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTarget_of_mul_product`
  Product rule for the completed-target Fox derivative when the source product is written in the
  completed group algebra.
