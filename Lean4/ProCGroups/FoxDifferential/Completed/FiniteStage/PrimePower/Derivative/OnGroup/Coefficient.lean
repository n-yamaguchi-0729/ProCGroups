# Fox differential: prime power — derivative — on group — coefficient

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetPrimePowerCompletedCoefficientHom`
  The completed target coefficient homomorphism is associated to the quotient
  \(\mathrm{FreeGroup}(X) \to F/N\). It sends a word to the corresponding group-like element of the
  prime-power completed group algebra of the target quotient.
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetPrimePowerCompletedCoefficientHom_apply`
  The finite Fox-stage target coefficient homomorphism into the prime-power completed coefficients
  is evaluated by the corresponding finite-stage coefficient map.
