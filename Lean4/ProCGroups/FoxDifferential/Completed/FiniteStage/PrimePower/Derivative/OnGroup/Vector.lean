# Fox differential: prime power — derivative — on group — vector

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTargetOnGroup`
  The dense group-level completed-target Fox derivative vector. It evaluates the completed-target
  derivative vector on group-like elements of the source completed group algebra.
- `primePowerCompletedGAFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTargetOnGroup_apply`
  The prime-power completed-group-algebra Fox-derivative vector is evaluated on group elements by
  the corresponding completed-target finite-stage formula.
- `primePowerCompletedGAFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTargetOnGroup_of`
  On a free generator, the completed-target derivative vector has the corresponding standard basis
  vector as its value.
- `primePowerCompletedGAFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTargetOnGroup_unique`
  The completed-target Fox derivative vector is the unique crossed homomorphism with standard basis
  values.
