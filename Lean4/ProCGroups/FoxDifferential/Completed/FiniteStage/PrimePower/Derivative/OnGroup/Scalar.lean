# Fox differential: prime power — derivative — on group — scalar

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTargetOnGroup`
  The dense group-level form of the completed-target Fox derivative. This is the completed-target
  derivative evaluated on group-like elements of the source completed group algebra.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTargetOnGroup_apply`
  The Fox derivative from the prime-power completed group algebra to the completed target is
  evaluated on group elements by the corresponding finite-stage formula.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTargetOnGroup_of`
  On a free generator, the group-level completed-target Fox derivative has the expected Kronecker
  generator value.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeToCompletedTargetOnGroup_unique`
  The group-level completed-target Fox derivative is the unique crossed homomorphism with its
  standard Kronecker values on free generators.
