# Fox differential: finite stage — prime power — derivative — vector

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTarget`
  The vector of all completed-target Fox derivatives, indexed by free generators.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFreeFoxDerivativeVectorToCompletedTarget_apply`
  Evaluation of the completed-target derivative vector at a coordinate.
