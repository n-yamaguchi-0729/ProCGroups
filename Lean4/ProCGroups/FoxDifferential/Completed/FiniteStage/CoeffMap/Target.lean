# Fox differential: completed — finite stage — coeff map — target

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetGroupAlgebraCoeffMap`
  Coefficient-reduction map on finite-stage target group algebras for a divisor \(n \mid m\).
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetGroupAlgebraCoeffMap_of`
  Evaluation of target coefficient reduction on a represented quotient word.
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetGroupAlgebraCoeffMap_of_quotient`
  Evaluation of target coefficient reduction on a quotient basis element.
- `foxAlgebraicStageTargetGroupAlgebraCoeffMap_single_apply`
  The finite-stage target coefficient map sends a singleton to the singleton with reduced
  coefficient and unchanged support.
