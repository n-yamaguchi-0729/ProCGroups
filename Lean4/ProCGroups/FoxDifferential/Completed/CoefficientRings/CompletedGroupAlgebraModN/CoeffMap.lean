# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — mod-\(n\) completed group algebra — coeff map

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `modNCompletedCoeffMap`
  The coefficient reduction map \(\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\) attached to a
  divisibility relation \(n \mid m\).
- `modNCompletedGroupRingCoeffMap`
  The coefficient reduction map on one residue-coefficient group ring.
- `modNCompletedCoeffMap_rfl`
  Coefficient reduction along reflexive divisibility is the identity map.
- `modNCompletedCoeffMap_comp`
  Coefficient change is performed stagewise: supports are unchanged and coefficients are transported
  by the given ring homomorphism.
