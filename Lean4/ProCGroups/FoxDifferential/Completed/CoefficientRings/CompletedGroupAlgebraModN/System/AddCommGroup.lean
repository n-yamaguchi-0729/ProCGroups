# Fox differential: coefficient rings — mod-\(n\) completed group algebra — system — add comm group

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `instAddCommGroupModNCompletedGroupAlgebraStage`
  Each finite mod-\(n\) group-algebra stage carries its standard additive commutative group.
- `instAddCommGroupModNCompletedGroupAlgebraFamily`
  The dependent family of finite mod-\(n\) group-algebra stages carries the pointwise additive
  commutative group structure.
- `coe_zero_modNCompletedGroupAlgebra`
  The inclusion of the mod-\(n\) completed group algebra into the ambient completed group algebra
  preserves zero.
- `coe_add_modNCompletedGroupAlgebra`
  The inclusion of the mod-\(n\) completed group algebra into the ambient completed group algebra
  preserves addition.
