# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — mod-\(n\) completed group algebra — augmentation

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `modNCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentation`
  The augmentation on one residue-coefficient finite stage.
- `modNCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationAt`
  The augmentation value of a residue-coefficient completed point, read at one finite stage.
- `modNCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentation_of`
  The finite-stage \(n\)-modular augmentation sends every group-like basis element to \(1\).
- `modNCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentation_compatible`
  Finite-stage \(n\)-modular augmentations are compatible with group-quotient transition maps.
