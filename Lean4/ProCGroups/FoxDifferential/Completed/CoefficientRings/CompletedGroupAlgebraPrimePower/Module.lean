# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — prime-power completed group algebra — module

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedCoeffToGroupAlgebra`
  The coefficient inverse limit maps canonically into the completed group algebra by taking the
  stagewise scalar units.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraTransition_algebraMap`
  Finite-stage transitions send scalar coefficients through the reduced coefficient algebra map.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentation_algebraMap`
  The finite-stage prime-power augmentation agrees with the scalar algebra map on coefficients.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_coeffToGroupAlgebra`
  The prime-power completed group-algebra projection on coefficients is computed by the
  corresponding group-algebra coordinate map.
