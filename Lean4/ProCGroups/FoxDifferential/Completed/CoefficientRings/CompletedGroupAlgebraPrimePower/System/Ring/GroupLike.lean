# Fox differential: prime-power completed group algebra — system — ring — group like

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraOf`
  The canonical map sends a group element to its compatible family of prime-power finite-stage
  group-like elements.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_one`
  The finite-stage projection sends \(1\) to \(1\).
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_mul`
  The finite-stage projection preserves multiplication.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_of`
  The prime-power completed group-algebra projection sends a group-like element to its finite-stage
  group-like class.
