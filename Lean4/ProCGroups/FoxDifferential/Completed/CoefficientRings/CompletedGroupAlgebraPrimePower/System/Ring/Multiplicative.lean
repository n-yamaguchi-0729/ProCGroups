# Fox differential: prime-power completed group algebra — system — ring — multiplicative

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `instRingPrimePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraStage`
  Each finite prime-power group-algebra stage carries its standard ring structure.
- `instRingPrimePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraFamily`
  The dependent family of finite prime-power group-algebra stages carries the pointwise ring
  structure.
- `coe_one_primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebra`
  The multiplicative identity in the prime-power completed group algebra is computed coordinatewise.
- `coe_mul_primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebra`
  Multiplication in the prime-power completed group algebra is computed coordinatewise.
