# Fox differential: prime-power completed group algebra — system — ring — projection

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_natCast`
  The finite-stage projection preserves natural number casts.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_intCast`
  The finite-stage projection preserves integer casts.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_zero`
  The finite-stage projection sends \(0\) to \(0\).
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraProjection_add`
  The prime-power finite-stage projection preserves addition.
