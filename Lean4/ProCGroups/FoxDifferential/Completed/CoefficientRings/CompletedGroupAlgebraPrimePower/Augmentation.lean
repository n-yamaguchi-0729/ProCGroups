# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — prime-power completed group algebra — augmentation

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentation`
  The prime-power completed group algebra carries a canonical augmentation to the corresponding
  coefficient inverse limit.
- `primePowerCompletedCoeffProjection_augmentation`
  Projecting the prime-power completed augmentation to a coefficient stage agrees with the
  corresponding finite-stage augmentation.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentation_eq_of_same_exponent`
  Stagewise augmentations of a completed group-algebra element are independent of the
  finite-quotient component once the prime-power exponent is fixed.
