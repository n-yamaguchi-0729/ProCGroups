# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — prime-power augmentation ideal — subtype linear

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdealAddEquivAddSubgroup`
  The inverse-limit augmentation ideal is additively equivalent to the additive kernel of the
  canonical prime-power augmentation.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdealLinearEquivAddSubgroup`
  The inverse-limit augmentation ideal is linearly equivalent to the additive kernel of the
  canonical prime-power augmentation.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdealToGroupAlgebraLinear_apply`
  The integral-linear inclusion of the prime-power augmentation ideal returns the underlying
  completed group-algebra element.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdealToGroupAlgebraCoeffLinear_apply`
  The coefficient-linear inclusion of the prime-power augmentation ideal returns the underlying
  completed group-algebra element.
