# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — prime-power augmentation ideal — augmentation

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationAddHom`
  The canonical prime-power augmentation as an additive homomorphism.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationRingHom`
  The prime-power completed augmentation bundled as a ring homomorphism.
- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentation_comp_coeffToGroupAlgebra`
  The prime-power completed augmentation composed with the coefficient-to-group-algebra map is the
  identity.
- `mem_primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdealAsIdeal_iff`
  A prime-power completed group-algebra element lies in the augmentation ideal iff its prime-power
  augmentation is zero.
