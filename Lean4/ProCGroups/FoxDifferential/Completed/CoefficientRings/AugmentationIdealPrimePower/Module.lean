# Fox differential: completed — coefficient rings — prime-power augmentation ideal — module

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraStageAugmentationIdealTransition_smul`
  The transition map between finite-stage augmentation ideals is compatible with scalar
  multiplication.
- `coe_smul_primePowerCompletedGroupAlgebraAugmentationIdeal`
  The inclusion of the completed augmentation ideal preserves scalar multiplication.
- `instSMulPrimePowerCompletedCoeffPrimePowerCompletedGAAugmentationIdealFamily`
  The family-level prime-power completed group-algebra augmentation ideal carries scalar
  multiplication by the prime-power completed coefficient ring.
- `instModulePpCoeffPpGAAugIdealFamily`
  The prime-power completed augmentation-ideal family is a module over the completed coefficient
  ring.
