# Fox differential: completed — free pro-\(C\) — uniqueness — derivative

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxDerivativeVector_unique_of_semidirect`
  Any continuous semidirect lift with the prescribed generator components has the canonical free
  pro-\(C\) completed Fox derivative vector as its left component.
- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxDerivativeVector_unique_of_continuousCrossedDifferential`
  Continuous completed crossed differentials on a free pro-\(C\) source are uniquely determined by
  their standard generator values, provided their semidirect graph is continuous.
- `freeProCZCCompletedCrossedDifferential_ext`
  Extensionality for continuous completed crossed differentials on a free pro-\(C\) source. The
  continuity hypotheses are put on the associated semidirect homomorphisms, which is the form used
  by the completed Fox construction before the target topology is fully structural.
- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxRightHom_eq_of_continuousCrossedDifferential`
  The coefficient homomorphism of a continuous completed crossed differential agrees with the right
  component of the canonical free pro-\(C\) semidirect lift.
