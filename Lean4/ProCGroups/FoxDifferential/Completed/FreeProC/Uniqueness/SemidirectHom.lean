# Fox differential: completed — free pro-\(C\) — uniqueness — semidirect hom

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxSemidirectHomOfCrossedDifferential`
  A completed crossed differential and its coefficient homomorphism combine into a semidirect
  homomorphism.
- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxSemidirectHomOfCrossedDifferential_left`
  The semidirect homomorphism attached to a crossed differential has \(\delta\) as its left
  component.
- `freeProCZCCompletedFoxSemidirectHomOfCrossedDifferential_right`
  The semidirect homomorphism attached to a crossed differential has \(\psi\)s its right component.
- `continuous_freeProCZCCompletedFoxSemidirectGenerator_of_crossedDifferential`
  If a crossed-differential semidirect homomorphism is continuous and has the standard generator
  coordinates, then the corresponding semidirect generator map is continuous.
