# Fox differential: common — free crossed differential

The principal declarations in this module are:

- `freeCrossedHomActionLift`
  The standard semidirect-product lift producing a free crossed homomorphism for an arbitrary
  additive action.
- `freeCrossedHomForAction`
  The free crossed homomorphism with prescribed generator values for a general additive action.
  This is the canonical action-level construction; scalar Fox differentials specialize it via
  `scalarCrossedAction`.
- `freeCrossedHomActionLift_right`
  The free-group component of semidirect multiplication.
- `freeCrossedHomForAction_of`
  The free crossed homomorphism takes each free generator to its prescribed basis value.
