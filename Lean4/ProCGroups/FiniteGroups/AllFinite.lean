# The class of all finite groups

This module defines `FiniteGroupClass.allFinite` and proves its standard closure properties:
formation, subgroup, normal-subgroup, quotient, finite-subdirect-product, extension, and
hereditary closure.  It also supplies the trivial-quotient instance used by pro-\(C\)
constructions when no restriction beyond finiteness is intended.
