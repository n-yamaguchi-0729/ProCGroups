# Finite-group classes and their closure properties

`FiniteGroupClass` bundles an isomorphism-invariant predicate whose members are finite.  The
module provides universe-independent membership through finite-group representatives and defines
the closure conditions used throughout the pro-\(C\) library, including formations, varieties,
Melnikov formations, hereditary classes, and full formations.

quotients lie in \(C\) also lies in \(C\). This is the two-factor form of (C4).
