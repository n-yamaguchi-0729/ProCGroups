# Countable descending open-normal chains

This file defines countable open-normal bases at the identity and characterizes them by descending
chains with trivial intersection. It also supplies the refinement property needed to use such
chains as neighborhood bases.

Preparatory countable-chain layer for later use: \(1\) has a countable fundamental system of
open normal subgroups. This isolates the part of the corollary that does not yet depend on the
not-yet-formalized cardinal invariant \(w_0(G)\) or on the generator-counting statements from
the later section on generators.

Compactness lemma for descending families of closed subgroups: if the total intersection lies
inside an open subgroup, then one term already lies inside that open subgroup.

/--
Preparatory countable-chain / neighborhood-basis equivalence for profinite groups: for a
profinite group, giving a countable descending chain of open normal subgroups with trivial
intersection is equivalent to giving a countable neighborhood basis at \(1\) formed by a
descending chain of open normal subgroups. This is exactly the chain-theoretic content of the
corollary; the generator-cardinality half will be added later once the \(w_0(G)\) /
convergent-generator formulation is in place.
