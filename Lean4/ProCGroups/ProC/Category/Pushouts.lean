# Pro C Groups / pro-C / Category / Pushouts

Pushout universal properties in `ProCGrp C` use mathlib's
`CategoryTheory.IsPushout` predicate and its standard `desc`, factorization,
extensionality, and comparison-isomorphism API. This module remains as the
stable import boundary for those definitions.
