# Closed kernels and the pro-\(C\) residual core

`ProCQuotientKernel C G` bundles a closed normal subgroup together with an open-normal
quotient-in-\(C\) basis on its quotient. The residual core is their intersection; closedness and
normality therefore follow directly from the stored kernel data, without reconstructing separation
axioms from the basis property.
