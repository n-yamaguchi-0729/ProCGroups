# Quotient formations and their subgroup topology

A quotient formation specifies admissible normal quotient kernels and their closure properties.
This file defines the induced open subgroups, pro-\(C\) closure, closed subgroups, and residuality,
and proves their basic lattice and separation characterizations.
