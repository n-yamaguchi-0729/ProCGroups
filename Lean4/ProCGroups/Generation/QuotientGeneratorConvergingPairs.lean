# Converging generators constructed through quotient refinements

`QuotientGeneratorConvergingPair` records a convergent generating family in a closed-normal
quotient together with coherent refinement maps.  Chain upper bounds and strict extensions feed
a maximality argument producing generators converging to one; the final results transport this
property and the resulting topological rank across surjections and continuous equivalences.
